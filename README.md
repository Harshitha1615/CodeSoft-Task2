OVERVIEW OF THE PROJECT : STUDENT GRADE CALCULATOR
OBJECTIVE: The objective of this task is to create a simple Java-based console application that allows a student to input their marks for different subjects, calculate the total marks, determine the average percentage, and assign a grade based on standard grading criteria.The objective of this task is to create a simple Java-based console application that allows a student to input their marks for different subjects, calculate the total marks, determine the average percentage, and assign a grade based on standard grading criteria.This project helps beginners practice basic programming concepts like user input, loops, conditions, and calculations in Java. It also encourages clean coding, logical thinking, and real-world application of grade evaluation systems used in academics.
KEY FEATURES: 
1.Total & Average Calculation : Automatically calculates total marks and average percentage based on user input.
2.Grade Assignment Logic : Determines grades (A+, A, B, etc.) using percentage ranges—just like in schools or universities.
3.Input Validation : Prevents invalid input (e.g., marks below 0 or above 100), improving the program’s accuracy and reliability.
4.Flexible Subject Entry : Accepts any number of subjects, making it useful for different student needs or exam patterns.
TECHNOLOGIES USED : 
1. Java Programming Language : Core language used to build the logic and structure of the application.
2. Java Scanner Class (java.util.Scanner) : Used to take user input from the keyboard.
3. Java Control Structures : (for loops: To iterate over subject entries) (if-else statements: For grade assignment and input validation)
4. Command Line / Terminal : The program runs in the terminal, making it light, fast, and easy to test.
CONCLUSION ABOUT THIS PROJECT : In summary, the Student Grade Calculator is a concise yet powerful console‐based Java application that guides beginners through essential programming concepts—user input, looping, conditional logic, validation, arithmetic operations, and clean code organization—while solving a relatable real‑world problem. By dynamically accepting any number of subjects, validating marks, computing totals and averages, and assigning accurate grades, the program not only reinforces logical thinking but also demonstrates how foundational Java skills can be applied to create practical, user‑friendly tools that mirror real academic grading systems.
